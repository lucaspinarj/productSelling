# YOUR PRODUCT HERE!
Playing with some HTML and CSS to create a mobile/desktop design to sell products via website. ðŸ˜†

This is obviously inspiration to studying html/css features, responsive design, practicing clean code and javascript integration.

Integrated mobile first into the project.

The button is functional and the website looks amazing!

For demo version reasons I'm not implementing javascript file yet. There is no real product to be shown since this is a showcase project. IF the need comes, I will create it, but for now, the functionability of the button is simple on purpose.
